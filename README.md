This was the first ever website created by me and my friend Aadil M J. Big thanks to him, he makes coding so much fun and helps a lot. So, the Idea of this website was a guessing game
game in which you try to guess the number that the computer is thinking. It's pretty simple and we are going to continue our coding journey together and produce big games/websites
in the future :D
